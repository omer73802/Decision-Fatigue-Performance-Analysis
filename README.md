# Decision-Fatigue-Performance-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between decision fatigue and user performance.
The goal is to understand how increasing cognitive load affects efficiency, accuracy, and overall results.

The analysis was conducted using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, following an end-to-end data analytics workflow.

## Analysis Process

### 1. Data Cleaning (Excel)
- Removed duplicates and missing values  
- Created calculated fields  
- Performed exploratory analysis using pivot tables  

### 2. Data Analysis (SQL)
- Aggregated performance metrics  
- Grouped users by fatigue levels  
- Identified trends using advanced queries  
- Performed filtering using HAVING and subqueries  

### 3. Visualization (Power BI)
- Designed an interactive dashboard  
- Built KPI cards and performance charts  
- Analyzed fatigue impact on productivity  

---

## Key Findings
- Higher fatigue levels are associated with lower performance scores  
- Decision time increases as fatigue increases  
- Users with balanced workloads show better consistency  

---

##  Business Recommendations
- Optimize task distribution to reduce cognitive overload  
- Implement break schedules to improve performance  
- Monitor fatigue indicators in real time
